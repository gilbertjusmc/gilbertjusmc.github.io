                        <p>My coding journey started like most I suspect, in highschool.  I took an intro to web design and ended up hating it.  It was drag and drop GUI based and it didn't appeal to me at the time.  If I had a glimpse at my current self, I would have stuck with it.  I had other interests at that time and only took the one class, not that there was a lot offered then.  I set it all on the back burner until about 2 years ago. I noticed the need for some better applications at my current job.  I starteed getting into Python and SQL to see if I could make a difference.  While I don't have much time during working hours, I spent a lot of off hours reading and practicing some.  Along the way I joined a small group within my current job that met during lunch to learn intro to programming.  It has covered a lot of things but not a lot of actual hands on practice.  I enrolled in a <abbr title="University of Michigan">U of M</abbr> Coursera class: Python for Everybody Specialization <a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/XUUR3ZQY7Y52">(Certificate)</a>.     </p>

                        <p>My time in the Corps is unforgettable.  I truly miss the esprit de corprs and look for that in my daily life.  I spent my time in small units which gave me the ability to wear multiple hats.  My primary MOS is 1341 (Heavy Equipment Technician) with a secondary of 1342 (Small Boat Mechanic).  My two main duty stations were <abbr title="Marine Corps Base Hawaii, Combat Service Support Group 3 ">MCBH, CSSG-3</abbr> now <abbr title="Combat Logistics Battalion 3">CLB3</abbr> and Battle Creek, MI <abbr title="Inspector, Instructor Staff">I&I duty</abbr></p>

                    <h1>Who I am</h1>
                    <p>I live in a small community of approximately 8400 people. The home I share with my girlfriend and her 2 teenage children is on a river where we enjoy kayaking. There are many opportunities in my home state of Michigan for outdoor activities which I love. Hiking and backpacking, mountain biking, and especially snowboarding. When an opportunity arises I also enjoy tree work, which may include climbing and trimming or complete removal. I find the technical aspects and the challenges of felling trees safely to be fulfilling. Photography is another hobby that I have become interested in pursuing more lately as well. </p>
                    <p>A 3 hour total daily commute brings me to my career in aviation maintenance. I enjoy riding my motorcycle, so when the weather cooperates, I ride as often as I can. I frequently work 10 hour shifts but the end of the day brings me back to my family. </p>
